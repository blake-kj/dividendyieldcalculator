# [My Task List](https://blake-kj-dividendyieldcalculator.netlify.app/)

Dividend Yield Calculator is a clean dividend yield calculator web application written in JavaScript and HTML using the Bootstrap CSS framework.

## What I Learned

JavaScript: simple math calculations in JavaScript to offer a result from the users inputs. Creating an error message element with Bootstrap classes and inserting it into HTML when the form is incorrectly completed.

Bootstrap CSS: offers more freedom and control when compared to a similar framework I used previously, Materialize CSS.
